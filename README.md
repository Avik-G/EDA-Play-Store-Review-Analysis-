  With the advent of modern technology and the ever increasing accessibility of the Internet and smartphones, people from all walks of life are getting exposed to the various applications available on the Play Store. This increase in accessibility has created a lucrative market for developers to introduce new apps on a regular basis to the Play Store. Currently there are 3.55 million Apps available on the Play Store as of 2022, with a highest of 4.67 million Apps in 2021. The decrease in the number of Apps shows that it is vital to develop a proper understanding of the user behaviour based on existing Apps in the Play Store and how they have performed. Since most Play Store applications are free, the income model is very obscure and inaccessible regarding how the in-application buys, in-application adverts and memberships add to the achievement of an application. In this way, an application's prosperity is normally dictated by the quantity of installation of the application and the client appraisals that it has gotten over its lifetime instead of the income is created. The objective of this experiment is to deliver insights to understand customer demands better and thus help developers to popularize the product.
